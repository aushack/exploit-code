============

Exploits, vulnerabilities, other stuff goes here.

* advisories/ - any published advisory information. I do my best to avoid reporting or disclosing bugs these days.
* msf/ - contains various <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework">Metasploit Framework</a> modules, which are not part of the official repository. If you want to use these modules, you may need to modify them to comply with the ever changing module format and framework APIs (I don't have the time, unfortunately).
* exploits/ - other exploits, which are standalone or otherwise not written in Metasploit.
* 0day/ - bugs I have noticed but don't care to report to vendor, nor publish advisories for, which aren't listed by anyone else on <a href="http://osvdb.org/">OSVDB</a>.
* vulnerabilities/ - things which don't go under msf or exploits.
